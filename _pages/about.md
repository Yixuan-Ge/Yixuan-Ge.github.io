Welcome!

I am a first year Ph.D. student in Finance at [NUS Business School](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/).â€‹ My research interests span from corporate finance, behavioral finance, and household finance to quantitative methods. Prior to my doctoral study, I obtained a B.Sc in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and an M.Sc in Mathematics.
